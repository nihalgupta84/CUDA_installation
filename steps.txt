Certainly! Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide to install the NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit on Ubuntu 20.04:

Step 1: Check the current NVIDIA driver and CUDA versions
1. Check the NVIDIA driver version: `nvidia-smi`
2. Check the CUDA version: `nvcc --version`

Step 2: Download the NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit
1. Download the NVIDIA driver (e.g., NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.54.14.run) from the NVIDIA website.
2. Download the CUDA toolkit (e.g., cuda_11.3.0_465.19.01_linux.run) from the NVIDIA website.

Step 3: Uninstall the existing NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit
1. Uninstall the existing NVIDIA drivers:
   ```
   sudo apt purge nvidia*
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```
2. Remove any leftover NVIDIA or CUDA files:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda*
   sudo rm -rf /opt/cuda*
   sudo rm -rf /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda*
   ```
3. Reboot the system: `sudo reboot`

Step 4: Install the NVIDIA driver
1. Switch to a text-only console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+F3.
2. Stop the display manager: `sudo service gdm3 stop`
3. Navigate to the directory where the NVIDIA driver installer is located.
4. Make the NVIDIA driver installer executable: `chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.54.14.run`
5. Run the NVIDIA driver installer: `sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.54.14.run`
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. Reboot the system: `sudo reboot`

Step 5: Install the CUDA toolkit
1. Navigate to the directory where the CUDA toolkit installer is located.
2. Make the CUDA toolkit installer executable: `chmod +x cuda_11.3.0_465.19.01_linux.run`
3. Run the CUDA toolkit installer: `sudo ./cuda_11.3.0_465.19.01_linux.run`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation (deselect the driver installation option).

Step 6: Set up the environment variables for CUDA
1. Open the `.bashrc` file: `nano ~/.bashrc`
2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
   ```
   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.3/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.3/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
3. Save the file and exit the editor.
4. Apply the changes to the current terminal session: `source ~/.bashrc`

Step 7: Verify the installation
1. Verify the NVIDIA driver installation: `nvidia-smi`
2. Verify the CUDA installation: `nvcc --version`
3. Reboot the system: `sudo reboot`

Additional Notes:
- If prompted to install NVIDIA's 32-bit compatibility libraries during the driver installation, select "No" unless you have specific 32-bit applications that require them.
- If prompted to run the `nvidia-xconfig` utility during the driver installation, select "Yes" to automatically update the X configuration file.
- If you encounter a warning about an incomplete installation during the CUDA toolkit installation, you can safely ignore it if you have already installed a compatible NVIDIA driver separately.

By following these steps, you should have the NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit installed and configured on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.
